# ZipHelper
Zip helper program that starts a metronome when holding guard

You may need to download .NET 6 Desktop Runtime: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

For what to enter in the guard button field, refer to the .NET Keys enum: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.keys?view=windowsdesktop-6.0

If the key cannot be parsed, the guard button will default to right mouse button (RButton)

Feel free to stop by and say hi if you enjoy the tool!
